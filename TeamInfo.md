## Project Summary

(Esportism) is a resource for aspiring esports players created by University of Illinois students that allows users to reference player and match statistics scraped from game APIs so they can do things like make comparisons of pro players, see average match performances at a given rank, analyze team compositions and roles, or compare themselves against pro players.
